# Jon's Cheque Book

A fast simple personal budgeting program.


This is based in my poor recollection of an old DOS program called Fred's Checkbook.


## Features

This program is intentionally rather limited in its feature-set. It is rather opinionated about how it should be used which means it may require you to adjust your habits rather than attempt to cater to the myriad of ways people handle their money. That means you might love it, or not.


Import transactions from TSV: There isn't an automatic integration to your bank but you can write your own tool to fetch your transactions and prepare a file that can be imported.

Repeatable transactions: You can make a transaction that to be repeated.
