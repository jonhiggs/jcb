# jcb

A TUI personal budgeting program.

If you're familiar with Mutt or vim, you'll find jcb quite intuitive.


## Workflow

Create the transactions, either by importing them from your bank, or creating them in the application.

Categorise your transactions and reconcile against your bank statement.

Commit the record of the transaction. This marks the transaction as read-only and also prevents any other records from being inserted before it.

Use the report to help you make financial decisions.

Repeat.
